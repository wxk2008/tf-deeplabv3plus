# tf-deeplabv3plus
this project is created based on the Google's tensorflow-project, the base net is mobilenetv2 and xception(41,65,71), 
if the model is trained base on the pre-train model, the mobilenetv2's Miou can be 84%, the xception's Miou can be 80%,
In addition, this project can be used Coco(172 classes) and Voc data(21 classes) to train the model
